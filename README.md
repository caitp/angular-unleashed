##Web Unleashed 2014 Angular Presentation

Oh my god I've put off putting this together for so long, it's time to get cracking and make it happen.

The plan is to show off:

1. The performance enhancements which Igor has tirelessly worked at, as well as the tools we've provided for improving performance in AngularJS applications.
2. The new features and long-awaited bugfixes. Some of these exist!
3. The developer tooling and support, particularly those built by the 2014 summer interns [**@ealtenho**](https://github.com/ealtenho) and [**@caguillen214**](https://github.com/caguillen214)

It's hard to sell this stuff, it's hard to get people excited, but dangit I hope to provide some cool demos which show just how hard we've worked at improving the developer experience with AngularJS.

There's more, but this is README.md on a repository where I'm supposed to be preparing my presentation, and quite frankly I have not even begun to do that just yet. There are only a few weeks left, I'm scared hold me ;______;

As usual, all of the materials here (excluding third party materials, covered below) are MIT-licensed, you can pretty much do what you like with it.
